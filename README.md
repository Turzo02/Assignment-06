4.Ans:
Destucturing allows us to extract value from an object or array and also assign them into variables

for example: 
const arr = [1,2,3]
the if we write thisðŸ‘‡ way , we are assigning the value of index 0 to a , index 1 to b and index 2 to c
const [a,b,c] = arr
after  that if we console.log(a,b,c) we will get 1,2,3 as a output
